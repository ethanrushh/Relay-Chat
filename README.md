Important: Relay Chat is a side project I'm working on for fun. Its not a commertial product, there is no guarrantee of data retention or that the servers will stay online - it's just for fun!

## What is Relay Chat
Relay Chat is a fun place to hang out and chat with your friends. Its been designed to capture the feel and experience of older chat apps. There are no servers and no user discovery - you need to know someone's username to add them. DMs don't exist by default. You create your own groups between users designed to be customized to your liking.

This is the sign up screen. To create an account, fill in the fields. Every username must be unique. Capitalization matters! (note: this is subject to change soon). It is recommended you save your password in your web browser of choice for faster entry on your next login.

Groups in Relay are the core of the user experience. To set up a DM with your first friend, head over to the Groups tab and select your friend(s). When you're ready, click Create Group. The new group chat should appear on your menu bar. Happy chatting!

### Images / GIFs

#### Uploading
Relay currently has entry level support for Images and GIFs. To send an image or GIF (which will be referred to only as Images from this point onward) click the Image Upload button as shown in the image above. To upload an image, select the file using the file selector that appears. When you're ready, press Upload. 
This will begin the file upload. Please allow a few moments for the upload to complete. The dialog will automatically disappear when the upload is complete and your message should appear in the group you're in. 

## Storage
### Where are my uploads stored?
Uploads are stored in a non-publically accessible AWS S3 bucket. This sits behind a Cloudfront instance that is public. Don't upload anything you don't want people to see. Files are hashed and the resulting hash is used for file names. This is to make sure that duplicate files are impossible to save on storage space. 
### Where are my text messages stored?
They are stored in a private MySQL database. Since this is a side project, DO NOT TRUST IT! Don't say anything you don't want to people to see currently. Again, this is NOT a commercial product but rather a tech demo of some full stack programming I have self-taught. 


## Help, Feature Requests or Support
Support for this application is not guarranteed at all. If you wish to help, need help with the app, have a feature request or would like to notify me of a bug you've spotted, message me through Relay! My username is `Ethan` (with the capital E). I have this app on my phone so I'll likely respond quickly to any messages you send me. Make sure to check back for a response!

## Source code?
The source code for the CDN gateway, messaging backend, (soon to be) Kubernetes files and front end will be available "soon". For security reasons I don't currently feel comfortable sharing this source code. If you would like a peek or wish to contribute, get in touch!

### The structure
![Blank diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82483782/216420301-72d61323-62c0-48da-9e19-49b83559b906.png)

This is pretty much the gist of how its set up at the moment. The APIs are hosted on t2.micro EC2 instances - cheap and powerful enough. I've designed it very intentionally such that someone could create their own front end client. I'm intentionally not obfuscating anything. 
There are plans to break this out to a more scalable solution. The main API will be split into a messaging and auth service separately at the absolute least. A CQRS design pattern has been used for the API (using MediatR).

### Tech stack

Pretty much its just:

ReactJS ~18.2 + HTML 5 + CSS 3

ASP.Net Core 7

GitHub

AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront, Route53, RDS Serverless v2) + Vercel


IDEs:
Vim, JetBrains Rider, VSCode

Of course there's more but READMEs are boring so if you're curious about more detail then feel free to reach out to me.
